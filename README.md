## pypxml

pypxml, short for **Py**thon **P**ickle E**x**tensible **M**arkup **L**anguage Library, is a Python module and as a human-readable alternative to [Pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html). Instead of saving data as a binary `.pkl` file, it saves data as an XML-based file called `.pypxml`. This makes it a lot more safer. The module uses the LXML module to parse `.pypxml` (XML) files.

The reason why I wanted to make this module is so that we (as humans) can easily what has been actually saved. I have to open `.pkl` files with Qt Creator to decode the binary and I (un)successfully managed to decode it.

I'm thinking of publishing this to PyPi, but maybe not so soon.
