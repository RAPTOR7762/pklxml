## pysxml

pysxml, short for **Py**thon Data **S**aving E**x**tensible **M**arkup **L**anguage Library, is a Python module and as a human-readable alternative to [Pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html). Instead of saving data as a binary `.pkl` file, it saves data as an XML-based file called `.pysxml`. The module uses the LXML module to parse `.pysxml` (XML) files
